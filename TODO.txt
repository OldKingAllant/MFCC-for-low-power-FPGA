DCT 

N = number of filters
n = unsigned range [1, N]

weights = [N][N] (number of cepstra = num of filters)

for each row:
row[i] = cos(PI * (i + 1 - 0.5) * i / N)

for filter in numfilters
  for cepstra in cepstras
	dot_result[i] += coeffs[filter] * weights[cepstra][filter]

dct[i] = sqrt(2/N) * dot_result[i]

which is
sqrt(2/N) * (coeffs[0] * weights[0][0] + coeffs[0] * weights[1][0] + ...)

Property of multiplication:
coeffs[0] * (sqrt(2/N)*weights[0][0]) + coeffs[0] * (sqrt(2/N)*weights[1][0]) + ...

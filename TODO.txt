- While the waveforms are correct when compared to a python implementation,
  their effective amplitude is wrong, starting from the fft. Understand why
  and fix it
- Maybe change dct from type 3 to type 2
- Higher log precision without increasing bits usedd by fraction?
- Verify whether a smaller number of multipliers in the filterbank
  does not break the pipeline (clock >> sampling rate)
